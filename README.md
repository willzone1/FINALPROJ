# FINALPROJ
**Final project for Dartmouth Thayer ENGS 62 course:**  
Used STM32F4-DISCOVERY boards with WiFly RN-XV modules to control a robot arm!  
  
Built upon the microcontroller basics we learned throughout the term - including, but not limited to:
- Simulators & debuggers
- ARM Cortex M4 instruction sets
- Memory maps & registers, memory-mapped peripherals
- Interrupt handling and synchronization
- Clocks & clock gating
- Serial communication - USART, UART, SPI, I2C
- ADC reading of external potentiometer, digital reading of accelerometer
